# AC-Current-sensing-with-overcurrent-protection
This circuit uses ZMCT103C to use as a current transformer with ratio 1000 : 1 as if a current of 1A passes in the wire a current of 1mA is induced in the CT
The value is calculated for a 50Hz Electric source and a microcontroller with  5V supply voltage
